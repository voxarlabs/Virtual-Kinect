## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted researches that depended onmaking tests on patients and teams that had to be divided to avoidcrowding in laboratories. Sharing equipment is no longer a simplestrategy; the acquisition of extra equipment is beyond the means ofmany researchers. Research with Kinect V2 applied to body track-ing suffers from sanitary restrictions, product discontinuation andlimited access to newer sensors (like the Azure Kinect). Kinect V2is an RGB-D sensor with many applications in health, ergonomics,sports, games and other areas. That is why a lot of research is stillunder development with it. Because of the applicability of Kinect V2on research and the current acquisition limitations, Virtual Kinect(VK) was created. VK is an open-source solution that enables theprogrammer to code using Kinect SDK functions and test it withouta Kinect V2 sensor or a previous recording. It simulates the be-havior of a Kinect V2 sensor through MediaPipe’s Pose estimation,providing RGB image and joint tracking information, correlatingthe joints of the two devices. This correlation is possible due tothe proximity of the devices’ joint estimates. The VK was made tobe simple and practical, so that its use only depends on the DLLexchange and the use of an ordinary RGB camera.
